After 10+ years of shifting between being a developer and a marketer, I found my perfect path as a consultant in the Salesforce ecosystem. What an amazing thing to join the Ohana... more than just a career, I found a new Trailblazers family!

Today I blazed my trail to become :
<ul>
<li>Community Group Leader since 2015</li>
<li>Lightning Champion</li>
<li>7x Salesforce certified</li>
<li>North Africa Dreamin organizer</li>
<li>Speaker at Dreamin events and Dreamforce</li>
</ul>
