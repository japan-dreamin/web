After enjoying the windy steppes of Kazakhstan, freezing-cold Siberian winters and endless rains in Seattle, Vladimir settled down in sunny San Francisco where he helps to drive product vision across several teams across Salesforce Platform. He started his career as an engineer working in multiple companies and soon developed a strong interest for cloud technologies. After spending three years at Microsoft working on Sharepoint Online, he joined Salesforce to help to deliver Global Picklists. Always feeling passionate about customer success, he transitioned to product management, and for the last few years was in charge of Custom Metadata Types, custom objects, custom fields and picklists. He's also a product manager behind "Where is this used?" button and all new Dependency API.
