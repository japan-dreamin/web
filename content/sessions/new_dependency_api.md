Metadata is a magical thing, empowering admins and developers to create powerful customizations that reflect the unique needs of their work. But as orgs grow, sometimes the relationships between different metadata components can become a bit complex. To make untangling metadata a piece of cake, we're happy to introduce the highly anticipated Beta release of the new Dependency API - an extension of the Tooling API designed for querying metadata dependencies throughout your org. In this session, we'll walk you through this exciting new API, show you live demos of it in action, and showcase the newly GA "Where is this Field Used?" button, which is built on top of the Dependency API. You'll walk away ready to hit one button to see where a particular custom field is referenced, and have the knowhow to leverage the Dependency API to untangle any org with ease.
