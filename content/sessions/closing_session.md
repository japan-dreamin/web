The Trailblazer Community is all about how we can succeed together. In this session, we'll discuss how to engage with the Trailblazer Community to learn, connect, have fun, and give back together. We'll take time to reflect on what we've learned and experienced at Japan Dreamin'. You'll walk away with inspiration to get involved in the community and great ideas to get started.
